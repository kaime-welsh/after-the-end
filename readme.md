[<img src="git_images/gameplay.gif">]()

## Main Mechanics
- Gather SCRAP to fix your downed shuttle in the center of the map
- Takes 1 O2 to move to a tile
- Tile Types:
	- Encounter:
		- Roll d6 against enemy d6, -1 HP to lower.
		- `-1 O2 x RING` on loss, otherwise `+1 SCRAP x RING`
		- At `0 HP`, player dies.
	- SCRAP pile: `+2 SCRAP x RING`, exhaust tile on use
	- O2 cache: `+2 O2 x RING`, does not exhaust on use
	- MERCHANT: `-1 02 x RING` for `+1 SCRAP x RING` and vice versa
- On return to ship, clear board and begin new day.
- Once `15 SCRAP` is found, ship is fixed and the game is won

## Stretch Goals

	- Sub-terranian lair with extra loot, and enemies. Exhausts on use.
- Items:
	- Laser Pistol:
		- +1 to attack roll
